# PPD Explorer

This is the repo for the HM Land Registry
[PPD explorer](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd),
which allows users to explore the Price Paid linked-data
for England and Wales.

## Developer notes

### Code overview

PPD is a fairly standard Rails app, albeit that the data
comes from a linked-data triple store via an API. ActiveRecord
is not used for this application.

The app does not interact directly with the triple store.
Instead, we use a simple DSL to send queries to the
[DS API](http://github.com/epimorphics/data-API). DS API uses
the structure of the hypercube, represented as a _data structure
definition_ (DSD), to convert the DSL queries to SPARQL.

### Accessing the API during development

In deployment, the Rails app will be run in an environment in
which the DS-API is available on `localhost:8080`. In development,
the script `bin/sr-tunnel-daemon` can be used to simulate that
environment, using ssh to proxy the remote dev API onto `localhost`.

### Coding standards

Rubocop should always return no errors or warnings.

### Running the tests

```sh
rails -t
```

## Deployment

To mimic running the application in a deployed state you can run
`make image` and this will run through the assets precompilation, linting and testing before creating a Docker image. To view the Docker container you can run `make run`

To bypass the need for running locally AWS you can pass a global variable to the command with `ECR=local make image`

You can run `make help` to view a list of other make commands available

### entrypoint.sh

This script is used as the main entry point for starting the app from the `Dockerfile`.

The Rails Framework requires certain values to be set as a Global environment variable
when starting. To ensure the `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` is only set in one place per
application we have added this to the `entrypoint.sh` file along with the `SCRIPT_NAME`.
The Rails secret is also created here.

There is a workaround to removing the PID lock of the Rails process in the event of
the application crashing and not releasing the process.

We have to pass the `API_SERVICE_URL` so that it is available in the `entrypoint.sh`
or the application will throw an error and exit before starting

### Prometheus monitoring

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is set up to provide metrics on the
`/metrics` endpoint. The following metrics are recorded:

- `data_api_status` (counter)
  Response from data API
- `data_api_connection_failure` (counter)
  Could not connect to back-end data API'
- `data_api_service_exception` (counter)
  The response from the back-end data API was not processed'
- `internal_application_error` (counter)
  Unexpected events and internal error count
- `memory_used_mb` (gauge)
  Process memory usage in megabytes

Internally, we use ActiveSupport Notifications to emit events which are
monitored and collected by the Prometheus store. Relevant pieces of the
app include:

- `app/lib/prometheus/metrics.rb`
  A central register where metrics can be stored and looked-up subsequently
  by use of a symbol key.
- `config/initializers/prometheus.rb`
  Defines the Prometheus counters that the app knows about, and registers them
  in the metrics store (see above)
- `config/initializers/load_notification_subscribers.rb`
  Some boiler-plate code to ensure that all of the notification subscribers
  are loaded when the app starts
- `app/subscribers`
  Folder where the subscribers to the known ActiveSupport notifications are
  defined. This is where the transform from `ActiveSupport::Notification` to
  Prometheus counter or gauge is performed.

In addition to the metrics we define, there is a collection of standard
metrics provided automatically by the
[Ruby Prometheus client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby)

To test Prometheus when developing locally, there needs to be a Prometheus
server running. Tip for Linux users: do not install the Prometheus apt
package. This starts a locally running daemon with a pre-defined
configuration, which is useful when monitoring the machine on which the
server is running. A better approach for testing Prometheus is to
[download](https://prometheus.io/download/) the server package and
run it locally, with a suitable configuration. A basic config for
monitoring a Rails application is provided in `test/prometheus/dev.yml`.

Using this approach, and assuming you install your local copy of
Prometheus into `~/apps`, a starting command line would be something like:

```sh
~/apps/prometheus/prometheus-2.32.1.linux-amd64/prometheus \
  --config.file=test/prometheus/dev.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path=./tmp/metrics2
```

Something roughly equivalent should be possible on Windows and Mac as well.
