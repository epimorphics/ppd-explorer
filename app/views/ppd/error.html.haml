  %h2 We're sorry, that didn't work
  %p
    We're very sorry, but the query you have just run did not complete. Reasons for
    this are commonly due to large queries exceeding the time limit,
    or the result set being too large to transmit.

  %p
    %strong
      Things you can try:

  %ul
    %li
      Make the query more selective. For example, add values for some of the other search
      fields, such as county, postcode or street. In particular, if you don't enter values for
      %em any
      address fields, you're implicitly doing a search for all addresses across England and Wales.
    %li
      Limit the years that the data is selected for. If you don't specify a start date, you
      will be querying the data going back to January 1995.
    %li
      Set the sample size. By limiting the number of results to 100 or 1000, you can try out
      your queries without risking timeouts in the query engine.
    %li
      If you have a large analysis that requires all of the data as input, you may be better
      to
      %a{ href: "https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads" } download the raw data
      and perform your own analysis using your own software.

  %p
    If you are still having difficulties accessing the data that you want, or you think that
    your query should have completed normally, please
    %a{ href: "/index.html#contact-us"}
      contact us.
